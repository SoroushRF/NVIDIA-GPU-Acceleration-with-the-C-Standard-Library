    "To that end, in order to make our applications capable to run in parallel, and in particular on massively parallel GPUs, we must look for opportunities to leverage the functions in the C++ algorithms library that provide an execution policy. For-loops are very often readily available to be refactored in just this way.\n",

Aside from being succinct and performant, your ability to write applications that are \"parallel first\" and capable of benifiting from GPU parallelism will hinge largely on your ability to work fluently with standard library algorithms."
