    "\n",
    "In order to be successful with these materials, you should fulfil the following prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beginner-level experience with C++11\n",
    "- Comfort working with C++ lambdas and standard library algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "For students who are comfortable writing C++ code, but lack experience using standard library algorithms and/or C++ lambdas, you will likely be able to spend a little extra time with the code in these materials and fully understand everything that is being taught. If needed, you may find it worth the effort to spend some time coming up to speed with their non-GPU-accelerated use using the wealth of free online materials that document them."
