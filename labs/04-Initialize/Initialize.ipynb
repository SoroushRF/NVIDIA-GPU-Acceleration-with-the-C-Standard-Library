When doing so, it is important to avoid unnecessary memory migrations across devices, including from the CPU to a GPU device. With this in mind, we would like to prepare the `initialize` function to also be able to perform its work in parallel, on the GPU device.\n",

    "The amount of work required to perform the initialization may not in fact be sufficient to saturate the available GPU, and were it the only computation in an application, might be best-suited for remaining on the CPU. However, because the time required to transfer memory between devices, including from the CPU to the GPU, an often be quite high, it is often a good idea to create and/or keep data on the GPU in order to reduce communication overheads. While the single function may not benefit from the acceleration, the overall performance of the application cab be improved."
